what I can see, it appears to be well within the realm of "evergreen"
skills" so I have a hard time imagining that learning to be more
proficient with it would be a waste of time-->

Practice Recipe Blog

## This is the basic gist of what this repo is about:

This is a dumpster fire, and that's okay.

I am working on learning CSS and sometimes the commits won't be great. The 
commit itself will be hopefully, but the markdown inside and how it renders on
the page might be rough for awhile. Learing web development is a long and 
necessary road, but I'm a little more interested in circuits and logic.


This template is intended to be a jumping off point for a website that will 
be a collection of recipes. This sole purpose at this point is to practice
HTML and CSS, and hopefully with a bit of peristence it will stop looking
so rough.

- [ ] Add that repo to your github 
- [ ] Finish this section 
- [ ] Study the way of the Master Programmer

## This is going to be a construction zone 

I should probably add some sort of picture to round out this bad larry. I would
post a picture of a site that I am going to try and mimic but I don't think
I would get that far at his point.
